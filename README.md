### About
This app helps users find a recipe by letting them select from a category, cuisine, random, or by list of ingredients. Most of the application uses the MealDB API to find recipes for dinner. Users can also add their own recipes. To delete a recipe, please use the contact form.

All recipes created without logging in will be available to everyone. After logging in, users can view a list of recipes available (both public and private) or log out from their profile page.
